# Server Module

This module handles the initial setup of the HTTP server and WebSocket endpoint for the PonGo game. Its primary responsibility is to accept incoming connections and forward them to the central [GameActor](../game/README.md) for management. It utilizes the [Bollywood Actor Library](https://github.com/<your-username>/bollywood) for interacting with the GameActor.
